          </h2>
          This is a prototype "make your own Stickman charecter" webcite. The user can create a stickman by
          changing the head, body, left arm, right arm, and legs. Users can under/redo and upload their own images
          to be ised for the stickman body. Users can upload, download, and save the stickman they have created.

          The cite has three main pages; the main page, file management page, and the help page. Each of these
          have a horizontal navigation bar with content below.

          <!-- CSS Modifications -->
          <h2 id="CSSModifications" class="help_headings"> 
               How CSS modifications are handled
          </h2>

          CSS rules for all pages are in "StyleSheet.css". Additional rules for the files page are in "StyleSheetFiles.css".</br>
          How the checklist CSS is implemented is described below.</br>
          Background color/image - the "body" css tag sets the font and image of the Background.</br>
          CSS header - the ".header" css sets the format for the header block. Changes padding, alignment, background, color, and font size. Makes block gold in color.</br>
          CSS nav bar color/image - set by the ".top_navigation", a, a:active, and a:hover css rule. Changes background color and hover colors of nav elements</br>
          CSS &lta&gt rule - set by "a:link" and "a:hover" css rules. Changes hover color and before click color of hyperlinks.</br>
          No gaps in stickman - Hanled with ".main_body_part" and ".main_body_display" tags setting space between pictures to 0px.</br>
          Stickman board - set by ".main_body_display" drawing the dasshed line around the man.</br>
          Help heading font change - ".help_headings" tag sets the font change.</br>
          The main page is broken into a left and right box managed by ".main_container_left" and ".main_container_right". These set the 
               width of each box. The first for the stickman, the second for everything else.</br>


          Files page is broken into multiple boxes managed by ".files_container", ".files_container_left", and ".files_container_right".
               This sets the size and display types of the containers.</br>
          There is a hidden stickman on the page to aid in holding data from the previous page, this is modified with ".hidden_box".</br>
          The file drag drop box is modified with ".drop-zone", ".drop-zone--over", ".drop-zone__thumb", ".drop-zone__input", and ".drop-zone__thumb::after".
               These are then changed with javascript to create a dynamic file drop zone that lights up when files are hovered above it. Then when
               files are placed inside, there will be a preview of the file placed with the name of the file dropped in. This code is based on Dcode's 
               example athttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wtrin7C4b7w and https://codepen.io/dcode-software/pen/xxwpLQo</br>
          The file load and delete buttons are styled with ".files_file_listing button" and ".files_file_listing button:hover". These allows
               a slow transition of color when hovering above the buttons on the file page for individual files.</br>
          
          <!-- Usage -->
          <h2 id="Usage" class="help_headings">

               the "Save Config" button and click the "Save Config" button. Do not include the ".json" file extension, this configuration will save as a JSON with the</br>
               name provided. To load a configuration from the Configuration Options section, type the exact filename that you would</br>
               like to load into the "Load Config" box and click the "Load Config" button. Any change to the stickman can be undon or redon by</br>

               configuration files must be a JSON. To see the format of the JSON, downlaod the "default.json" to see how it is configured. Then: </br></br>
